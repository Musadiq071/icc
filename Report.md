Background of the enterprise: The small business we will talk about is a superstore named as Grab Now. It was started 6 years ago.
•	Current IT setup:
 At present the store uses physical server for storing all their data and applications. They offer shopping website which is hosted on a separate server. They have a local network for their employees to access the server.
•	Recommendations:
1.	Contrast of cloud vs non-cloud solutions for each aspect of the infrastructure:
	Data Storage: 
Non-cloud: physical server
Cloud: Cloud storage solutions like Google Cloud storage, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon.
	Website Hosting:
Non-Cloud: physical server
 Cloud: Cloud Hosting Solutions like Elastic beanstalk, Microsoft Azure, or Google app Engine
	Applications: 
Non-Cloud: Physical server
Cloud: Cloud Solution like AWS, and google app engine
2.	Further recommendations what service level and deployment type is appropriate for each aspect of their infrastructure
	Data Storage:
 I recommend using a hybrid cloud model for the business as it offers data and applications to be shared between clouds with much flexibility and deployment options like AWS(Paas).
	Applications: 
I recommend using a hybrid cloud model like AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Paas). This will offer them greater customization options and it’s cost-effective too.
	Website hosting: 
I would suggest the Hybrid cloud model like Elastic beanstalk(Paas) which will provide you Scalability and easy data recovery in case of any data loss as compared to a physical server where data is stored only on one server. 
3.	justification for each final recommendation provided:
	Data Storage 
By implementing the suggested cloud storage solution like google cloud storage, IBM Cloud, or AWS you will have the flexibility in accessing data so the staff can access the data from anywhere around the world. On the upside, its cost-effective with zero maintenance as these services are offered by the cloud.
	Application 
By working on the cloud solutions such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Iaas), they can easily deploy and do strong customization to their apps. Furthermore, it is time-saving and cost-effective too. Businesses don’t need to spend extra on top of the AWS service you use.
	Website Hosting 
By using cloud computing solutions business will get more scalability and reliability. Moreover, they don’t have to worry about data loss and recovery because cloud hosting is a multi-server setup that allows for an automatic backup of data.
